# Elevate Labs - SQL Developer Internship Task 6

## Task Overview
This project is the sixth task for the SQL Developer Internship. The objective is to practice using subqueries (or nested queries) to solve complex problems that require multi-step logic.

- **Tools Used:** MySQL Workbench

---
## SQL Queries
The `subqueries_script.sql` file contains the main deliverable for this task. It includes a series of queries that demonstrate the use of subqueries in different clauses:
- **`WHERE` clause:** Using `IN` and scalar subqueries to filter data based on the results of another query.
- **`FROM` clause:** Using a subquery as a temporary "derived table" to query from.
- **`SELECT` clause:** Using a scalar correlated subquery to calculate a value for each row.
- **`EXISTS`:** Using a correlated subquery to check for the existence of related data.

## Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What is a subquery?
A subquery, or nested query, is a complete `SELECT` query that is placed inside another SQL query.

### 2. Difference between subquery and join?
A **`JOIN`** combines tables horizontally to create a single result set. A **subquery** is a separate query that returns a value or a set of values that the outer query then uses, often for filtering in a `WHERE` clause.

### 3. What is a correlated subquery?
A correlated subquery is an inner query that depends on the outer query for its values. It runs once for each row processed by the outer query, which can make it less efficient.

### 4. Can subqueries return multiple rows?
Yes. Multi-row subqueries are used with operators like `IN`, `NOT IN`, `ANY`, and `ALL`.

### 5. How does EXISTS work?
The `EXISTS` operator tests for the existence of any records in a subquery. It returns `TRUE` if the subquery returns one or more records, otherwise it returns `FALSE`.

### 6. How is performance affected by subqueries?
Subqueries, especially correlated ones, can negatively impact performance because the inner query might be executed repeatedly. However, modern database optimizers can often rewrite them as more efficient `JOIN`s.

### 7. What is scalar subquery?
A scalar subquery is a subquery that returns a single value, which is exactly one row with one column.

### 8. Where can we use subqueries?
Subqueries can be used in several places within a larger query, including the `SELECT` list, the `FROM` clause, the `WHERE` clause, and the `HAVING` clause.

### 9. Can a subquery be in FROM clause?
Yes. When a subquery is used in the `FROM` clause, it is referred to as a derived table.

### 10. What is a derived table?
A derived table is a temporary, virtual table that is generated by a subquery in the `FROM` clause of an outer query. This table exists only for the duration of the outer query.
